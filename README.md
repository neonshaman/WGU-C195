# WGU-C195
Update 7/2020: After realizing I uploaded the copmiled class files only, I decompiled them to upload here for viewing using the Java Decompiler Project tool (http://java-decompiler.github.io/).

This project was the culmination of Software II. It was developed with Java, JavaFX, and MySQL in the Netbeans IDE. 
The scenario presented for this project follows:

"You are working for a software company that has been contracted to develop a scheduling desktop user interface application. The contract is with a global consulting organization that conducts business in multiple languages and has main offices in Phoenix, Arizona; New York, New York; and London, England. The consulting organization has provided a MySQL database that your application must pull data from. The database is used for other systems and therefore its structure cannot be modified.
The organization outlined specific business requirements that must be included as part of the application. From these requirements, a system analyst at your company created solution statements for you to implement in developing the application. These statements are listed in the requirements section."

This application is joined on the backend by a MySQL database, connected with standard jdbc. To demonstrate proficiency with localization, some minor features were implemented that would be built out more fully in actual business use. As the requirements were unclear on some details, I presented two time-based solutions in the code, the assumed case where where clients and consultants schedule and meet locally, and the framework for one where clients and consultants meet remotely (commented out in code, but demonstrated for evaluators).
